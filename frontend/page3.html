        <p>You're doing great! Keep it up and stay healthy. Here are a few tips to keep your heart in top shape:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Keep moving:</strong> Regular exercise helps keep your heart strong. Aim for at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity activity per week.</li>
            <li><strong>Watch what you eat:</strong> Focus on a balanced diet rich in fruits, veggies, whole grains, and healthy fats. Limit processed foods and sugar.</li>
            <li><strong>Manage stress:</strong> Yoga, meditation, and deep-breathing exercises can reduce stress and lower your heart disease risk.</li>
            <li><strong>Stay on top of your health:</strong> Regular check-ups and monitoring blood pressure and cholesterol can help detect any issues early.</li>
            <li><strong>Sleep Well:</strong> Prioritize 7-9 hours of quality sleep to ensure your body and heart function optimally.</li>
        </ul>
        {% elif prediction_percentage < 70 %}
        <p class="important-message">Your heart health is something to watch closely. Consider taking proactive steps to reduce risks:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Get moving:</strong> Make exercise part of your routine. Start slow, but aim for consistent physical activity like walking, swimming, or cycling.</li>
            <li><strong>Quit smoking:</strong> If you're smoking, stop now. Smoking is a leading cause of heart disease, and quitting will dramatically improve your health.</li>
            <li><strong>Watch your cholesterol:</strong> Keep an eye on your cholesterol levels. Eating heart-healthy fats like those found in avocado, olive oil, and nuts can help.</li>
            <li><strong>Consider a health coach:</strong> If you're unsure how to get started, a health coach or personal trainer can guide you through lifestyle changes.</li>
            <li><strong>Hydrate well:</strong> Drinking enough water throughout the day can improve circulation and overall health.</li>

        {% else %}

        <ul>
            <li><strong>See a doctor:</strong> Book an appointment with a healthcare professional to discuss your risk factors and get personalized guidance.</li>
            <li><strong>Improve your diet:</strong> Work on cutting back on high-sodium foods and processed meats. Opt for whole foods and plant-based meals.</li>
            <li><strong>Increase physical activity:</strong> Aim for 30 minutes of heart-healthy activities like brisk walking, running, or cycling at least 5 days a week.</li>
            <li><strong>Track your progress:</strong> Keep track of your health metrics like blood pressure, cholesterol, and weight. Monitor improvements and adjust your actions.</li>
            <li><strong>Quit alcohol:</strong> Reducing alcohol consumption can reduce your risk. Consider limiting intake to keep your heart healthy.</li>
